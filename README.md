# fish-pyenv

Pyenv plugin for the Fish shell.

This plugin replaces what `status --is-interactive; and . (pyenv init -|psub)`
does in a more fishy way. This brings the startup time of your shell down
as we do not generate full completions every time the shell starts but only
when `pyenv` gets called.

## Install

* fisherman: `fisher install pyenv`
